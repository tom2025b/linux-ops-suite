## thomas-tui: second extraction — text truncation + centering helpers

Pulled two more zero-coupling pieces from suite-ui into `thomas-tui`, same
move-and-re-export pattern as the Tui guard:

- **`text.rs`** (`truncate_path` / `truncate_desc`) — `git mv`'d whole into
  `thomas-tui/src/text.rs` (rename preserved history; only doc phrasing + the 2
  doctests changed `use suite_ui::` → `use thomas_tui::`).
- **`centered_rect` / `centered_fixed`** — extracted from `suite-ui`'s
  `widgets.rs` into a new `thomas-tui/src/layout.rs` (with their 3 tests). The
  pane helpers (`pane`/`pane_titled`/`pane_blank`) use `Theme`, so they STAYED in
  suite-ui's widgets.rs — this was a partial split, not a whole-file move.

**Re-export wiring (suite-ui API unchanged):**
- suite-ui `lib.rs` re-exports `truncate_*` from `thomas_tui`; `mod text;` gone.
- suite-ui `widgets.rs` re-exports `centered_*` from `thomas_tui`, so the 3
  overlays (confirm/help/palette) that import `crate::widgets::centered_*` and
  `lib.rs`'s `pub use widgets::{centered_*, ...}` all keep resolving untouched.

**Verified:** test count lossless — suite-ui unit 86→77, thomas-tui unit 6→15
(the 6 text + 3 centering tests moved); doctests suite-ui 18→16, thomas-tui 0→2.
77+15=92 conserved. clippy -D warnings clean on both; fmt clean; gallery builds.

**thomas-tui now owns:** Tui guard, text truncation, centering helpers.

## thomas-tui: new general-purpose TUI crate — first extraction (Tui guard)

Started a new, project-agnostic terminal-UI library `crates/thomas-tui`, separate
from `suite-ui` (which stays suite-specific). First component extracted: the
`Tui` RAII terminal scope guard.

**Why the Tui guard first:** it was the only suite-ui component with zero coupling
— no `Theme`, no suite vocabulary (`Severity`/`Health`/`JobState`), deps are just
`crossterm` + `ratatui`. It's also the highest-repeat boilerplate every TUI app
needs (panic-safe raw-mode/alt-screen teardown, `suspended()` for child editors,
post-child input drain) and was already fully tested.

**What changed:**
- New crate `crates/thomas-tui` (Cargo.toml + lib.rs), added to workspace members.
- `git mv crates/suite-ui/src/app/tui.rs → crates/thomas-tui/src/tui.rs` (rename
  preserved history; only 2 doc-comments generalized — no logic changed).
- `suite-ui` now depends on `thomas-tui` (path dep) and **re-exports**
  `Tui/TuiError/TuiOptions` from `app/mod.rs`. suite-ui's public API is unchanged:
  consumers still `use suite_ui::Tui`. Single source of truth, no duplication.

**Verified:** `cargo test -p thomas-tui -p suite-ui` green. Test count is lossless
— baseline suite-ui 92 → now suite-ui 86 + thomas-tui 6 (the relocated guard
tests). Gallery example builds; clippy + fmt clean on the new crate.

**Branch:** `worktree-thomas-tui-extract` (committed in worktree, not yet merged
to main, not pushed). NOTE: suite-ui changes normally land via PR to umbrella main
— but this commit touches suite-ui only by swapping its `Tui` impl for a re-export
(API-identical), alongside the new crate.

**Next candidates (per the extraction plan):**
1. `text.rs` (truncate_path/desc) + the two `centered_*` helpers — also zero-coupling.
2. **Split `Theme`** — pure styling (accent + NO_COLOR gate + prompt/title/dim/
   selection/...) down into thomas-tui; leave `Severity`/`Health` in suite-ui as a
   domain layer. This is the gate that unlocks the Tier-B widgets (SearchBar,
   KeyHints, EmptyState, Counted, FilterChips, ...).
3. Re-derive Tier-C domain widgets (SeverityBadge, StatusBar/JobState, AttentionFlag,
   HealthStrip, ToastKind) as GENERIC primitives in thomas-tui; suite-ui specializes.
